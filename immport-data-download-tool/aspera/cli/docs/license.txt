END-USER LICENSE AGREEMENT 
Last updated 09Jul2015
This End-User License Agreement (the "Agreement") is a legal contract between you ("User") and International Business Machines Corp. or one of its subsidiaries (ÒIBMÓ), the owner of certain software programs that have been provided to User either by IBM or on behalf of IBM by a third party to which IBM has granted the right to license or to sublicense the Software Programs (a "Licensee").
BY INSTALLING, COPYING, OR OTHERWISE USING THE SOFTWARE PROGRAMS, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMER, LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, AND TERMINATION PROVISIONS BELOW.
* The "Software Programs" mean: (a) the computer software programs and related documentation owned or licensed by IBM that are being installed by User; (b) IBM software programs embedded in third party software programs that User is installing; and (c) all maintenance releases, updates, upgrades, or features to the Software Programs, if any, provided by IBM directly or indirectly through a Licensee to User.
* User may install and use the Software Programs pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Use of the Software Programs is non exclusive and limited to User's internal use thereof, which use may not exceed the term or the scope of the license purchased (e.g., but not by way of limitation, the permitted number of copies, seats, servers, active user accounts, or transfer bandwidth capacity purchased) and as authorized by IBM in writing. If User has any questions regarding the term or scope of the licensed purchased, User is to contact IBM Sales at: sales@IBMsoft.com.
* Most Software Programs are activated by delivery of a license key or entitlement system, which license keys or entitlement systems may be designed to allow use of the Software Programs in compliance with the scope of the license granted and termination of the license for non-compliance with the applicable License. Further, Software Programs may contain a metering or instrumentation capable of verifying license entitlement and transmitting reports or statistics on the Software Program usage to IBM or a third party engaged by IBM to collect any such reports or statistics.
* User shall not upload, install, or copy the Software Programs for use in an Internet hosted service established to provide Infrastructure-as-a-Service ("IaaS"), Platform-as-a-Service ("PaaS"), and Software-as-a-Service ("SaaS") for use by end users over the Internet (for the purpose of this Agreement, a "Cloud Environment") without specific license from IBM. In the event IBM grants User permission, in writing, to upload, install, or copy the Software Programs for use in a Cloud Environment, User must present the terms of this Agreement to any user who accesses the Software Programs from the Cloud Environment. Any such user is the "User" of the Software Programs and as such hereby agrees to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. 
* User shall not: (a) sublicense, lease, rent, or transfer the Software Programs, in whole or in part, to a third party in any way; or (b) use the Software Programs for third-party training, commercial time-sharing, rental, or service bureau use.
* User shall not: (a) make or distribute copies of the Software Programs (provided that User may make one copy for backup purposes only); (b) alter, merge, modify, or adapt the Software Programs or make derivative works thereof; or (c) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, or otherwise derive the source code of the Software Programs. Where applicable law would permit User to decompile, disassemble, or otherwise reverse engineer the Software Programs by any means whatsoever to achieve interoperability, User hereby agrees that should User exercise such legal permission, any such information obtained by User shall be treated for all purposes hereunder as the confidential and proprietary information of IBM. 
* User may not transfer any rights under this Agreement without the prior written consent of IBM, with the exception that User may, at no additional cost, transfer the Software Programs to any hardware platform or operating system supported by IBM. Once a Software Program which is permitted to be installed at a third party location is so installed, such Software Program may not be uninstalled and reinstalled in a second location.
* User shall not use or combine any open source software with the Software Programs in any manner that would subject any Software Programs or confidential or proprietary information of IBM or its suppliers to the provisions of GPL, LGPL or similar open source terms and conditions.
* User may only use a "not for resale" version of the Software Programs to review and evaluate the Software Programs.
* User shall pay, taxes of any and all kind, including but not limited to, sales, use, excise, value added tax, or import or export (or similar tax or duties), levied upon delivery of the Software Programs. If applicable law requires User to withhold any income taxes levied on payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement ("Withholding Tax") User shall increase such payment to IBM so that, after deduction for Withholding Tax, IBM receives payments as if no Withholding Tax had been deducted.
* User warrants it will not export, directly or indirectly, any information acquired under this Agreement or any Software Programs utilizing any such information to any country prohibited by the laws of the United States, or for which the U.S. Government or any agency thereof at the time of export requires an export license or other government approval without first obtaining such license or approval. Further, User agrees that the costs of such compliance, including but not by way of limitation, bonds, duties, or taxes shall be User's obligation.
* If User is a sublicensee (i.e., receiving the Software Programs from a Licensee), (a) the use of the Software Programs by such User is subject to all the limitations set forth in the license agreement between IBM and such Licensee and may be no greater in scope than the rights IBM has granted to Licensee; and (b) User shall be bound by the scope of the license (e.g., but not by way of limitation, the permitted number of copies, seats, servers, active user accounts, or transfer bandwidth capacity purchased) purchased under the license agreement between the Licensee and IBM. 
* If User is licensing Software Programs as a business and not as a consumer, this license shall take effect between IBM and User as a business entity and User shall take all appropriate steps to ensure that the Software Programs are operated by User's employees, agents, or contractors in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 
* The license set forth in this Agreement grants the User a limited license to use the Software Programs. Subject to Section 20 below, IBM retains all right, title and interest, including all copyright and intellectual property rights, in and to, the Software Programs and all copies thereof. All rights not expressly granted in this Agreement are reserved by IBM. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you may use the software only as expressly permitted in this Agreement.
* User hereby grants IBM a non-exclusive, perpetual, non-terminable, worldwide, royalty free right and license to use, reproduce, modify, create derivative works of, display, import, disclose, distribute, sublicense, rent, lease, lend copies of, and otherwise exploit any suggestions, ideas, enhancement requests, feedback, recommendations, or other information provided by User directly or indirectly to IBM or created for User by IBM or its Licensee that relate to IBM's software or technology.
* IBM PROVIDES THE SOFTWARE PROGRAMS "AS IS" AND DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE PROGRAMS FURNISHED TO USER WILL MEET USER'S REQUIREMENTS OR THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE PROGRAMS WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, IBM DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. NO RIGHTS OR REMEDIES REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 2A OF THE UCC WILL BE CONFERRED ON USER UNLESS EXPRESSLY GRANTED HEREIN. THE SOFTWARE PROGRAMS ARE NOT DESIGNED, INTENDED, OR LICENSED FOR USE IN HAZARDOUS ENVIRONMENTS REQUIRING FAIL-SAFE CONTROLS AND IBM SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR SUCH PURPOSES.
* IF AND ONLY IF APPLICABLE LAW REQUIRES ANY WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE PROGRAMS, IBM WARRANTS THAT THE SOFTWARE PROGRAMS WILL PEFORM SUBSTANTIALLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTATION FOR A PERIOD OF NINETY (90) DAYS FROM THE DATE THE SOFTWARE PROGRAMS ARE FIRST MADE AVAILABLE FOR USE BY USER. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY IBM, ITS RESELLERS, ITS REMARKETERS, ITS LICENSEES; ITS AGENTS, OR EMPLOYEES SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY OR IN ANY WAY INCREASE THE SCOPE OF ANY WARRANTY PROVIDED HEREIN. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE EXCLUSION AND DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES ABOVE MAY NOT APPLY TO USER. 
* To the extent permitted by applicable law, neither party shall have any liability for incidental, consequential, indirect, special, exemplary, or punitive damages; or liabilities of any kind for loss of revenue, loss of profits, loss of business, loss of data, interruption of business, cost of replacement goods, or other financial loss arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or any order, regardless of the form of the action, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), strict product liability, or otherwise, even if any representative of a party hereto has been advised of the possibility of such damages and even if any limited remedy specified in this Agreement or any order is deemed to have failed of its essential purpose. Provided, however, that the parties expressly agree that any express payment obligation of User under this Agreement or any order shall be deemed direct damages and no portion of any such express payment obligation shall be deemed consequential damages within the meaning of this Section 18. 
* To the extent permitted under applicable law, IBM's total liability with respect to claims arising from or in connection with its performance, or observance of its obligations or otherwise under this Agreement or any order, regardless of the form of the action, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or other legal or equitable theory shall in no circumstances exceed the lesser of: (a) amounts paid by licensee to IBM in the six (6) months preceding the event or (b) ten thousand United States dollars ($10,000). IBM's maximum aggregate liability, regardless of the form of the action, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or other legal or equitable theory in respect to, arising from, or in connection with its performance or observance of its obligations, or otherwise under this Agreement and all purchase orders is fifty thousand United States dollars (U.S. $50,000).

Any rights of User to any such services shall be solely as provided in a service, support and maintenance, or other agreement between User and IBM (or between Licensee and IBM if User is a sublicense) and subject to the conditions therein. In no event shall User have any rights to enforce against IBM any provisions of any license agreement or other agreement to which it is not a party. 
* User agrees that IBM may audit User's use of the Software Programs for compliance with the terms of this Agreement at any time, upon reasonable notice. In the event that such audit reveals any use of the Software Programs by User other than in full compliance with the terms of this Agreement, User shall: (a) reimburse IBM for all reasonable expenses related to such audit in addition to any other liabilities to which User may be subject as a result of such non-compliance; and (b) pay IBM for all additional license required to bring User's past use of the Software Programs into compliance with the terms of this Agreement plus interest thereon calculated at 1.5% per month (but in no event more than the maximum amount allowed by law) from the date User should have purchased the additional licensees to avoid non-compliance with the terms of the Agreement. User acknowledges that IBM shall have the right to enforce the provisions of this Agreement directly against User, and IBM's remedies for any breaches may include, without limitation, damages, or injunctive or other equitable remedies.
* IBM may terminate the rights granted hereunder if User breaches this Agreement. In such event, User must destroy all copies of the Software Programs. 
* If the Software Program license purchased by User is a subscription plan or for a fixed term, User must destroy all copies of the Software Programs upon expiration of the subscription plan or fixed term.
* If User is a sublicensee, the rights granted hereunder shall automatically terminate upon the termination or expiration of the license agreement between IBM and the Licensee; and User must destroy all copies of the Software Programs.
* This Agreement contains the complete agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and replaces any prior oral or written communications between Licensee and IBM. In entering into this Agreement neither party is relying on any representation that is not specified in this Agreement including without limitation any representations concerning: (a) the performance or function of the Software Programs, other than as expressly warranted in Section 17 above; (b) the experiences or recommendations of other parties; or (c) any results or savings that Licensee may achieve. Additional or different terms in any written communication from Licensee (such as a purchase order) are void.

This Agreement does not authorize User to use IBM's or its licensor's names or any of their respective trademarks. 
* If any part of this Agreement is found to be void and unenforceable it will not affect the validity of the remainder of the Agreement, which shall remain valid and enforceable according to its terms.
* If the Software Programs are being licensed by the U.S. Government directly or indirectly through a civilian agency or third party, any Software Programs and related documentation are "Commercial Items" as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. ¤2.101, consisting of "Commercial Computer Software" and "Commercial Computer Software Documentation," as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. ¤12.212 (and all corresponding agency specific Federal Acquisition Regulation supplements). Consistent with the foregoing, the Commercial Computer Software and Commercial Computer Software Documentation are being licensed to the U.S. Government end users (a) only as Commercial Items and (b) with only those rights as are granted to all other end users pursuant to the terms and conditions herein.
